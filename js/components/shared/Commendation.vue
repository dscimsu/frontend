                        <p>Studacom.ng (now myPadi.ng) was so helpful during my 100 level in UNIBEN. Cosmos who was one of their staff was so patient in ensuring that I get the best place around Ekosodin. May God reward you guys for coming to my aid. </p>

                        <p>Tessy Brown Crib was built in 2014 at Delta State Polytechnic, Ozoro. After the sudden drastic reduction in admission quota by the polytechnic regulatory body in 2016,  we suffered great lost as there were no students to book for accommodation, my hostel was virtually empty throughout that year. But that was before  I came in contact with Mypadi.ng ( formerlly Studacom.ng) in 2017.  Since then our bookings has increased by over 60%</p>
